Project Title: Predicting Flu Vaccine Likelihood

Overview:
This project is part of a hackathon aimed at predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving their xyz and seasonal flu vaccines. The dataset provided contains various features related to respondents' behaviors, opinions, demographics, and health conditions. The goal is to predict the probabilities of respondents receiving both the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines.

Files Included:
Hackathon_Week_3.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Hackathon_Week_3.py: Python script converted from the Jupyter Notebook for easier code sharing and execution.
submission.csv: CSV file containing the predicted probabilities for the xyz and seasonal flu vaccines.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages and dependencies required to run the code.

Requirements:
Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary packages listed in requirements.txt. You can install the required packages using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd your_repository

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess data, train models, evaluate performance, and generate predictions.

The output predictions will be saved in submission.csv.
